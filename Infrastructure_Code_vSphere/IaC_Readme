This is an infrastructure as a code example which I used in my homelab to provision and deploy the vcenter and 2 ESXi servers. Everything should be automated.

The deploy_vcsa.json is the template provided by vmware but edited by me and configured to be deployed for my homelab environment. 

We can directly use this to deploy the vCenter but better way is to use this with terraform to deploy the vCenter. 

Download this file to the system where the ova file is stored, like this ova is mounted to my CD/DVD drive on my windows system and I will download this script and edit 
it and run it on the same windows system.
